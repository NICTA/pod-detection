Ruby PHP Serializer
===================

This module provides two methods: PHP.serialize() and PHP.unserialize(), both
of which should be compatible with the similarly named functions in PHP.

Basic usage:

 require 'php_serialize'
 in = {'foo' => 'bar'}
 php = PHP.serialize(in)
 # pass string to PHP unserialize() to get array('foo' => 'bar')
 out = PHP.unserialize(php) # => {'foo' => 'bar'}


PHP.unserialize can also read PHP sessions, which are collections of named
serialized objects.  These can be reserialized using PHP.serialize_session(),
which has the same semantics as PHP.serialize(), but which only supports
Hash and associative Arrays for the root object.
